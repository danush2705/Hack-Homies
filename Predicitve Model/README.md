## Usage

1. **Breast Cancer Detection:**
   - Run `final.py` for testing the breast cancer detection model.

2. **Lung Cancer Detection:**
   - Run `lung_train.py` to train the lung cancer detection model.
   - Run `lung_test.py` for testing the lung cancer detection model.

3. **Combination Model:**
   - Utilize `final_comb_disease_mod.py` for the final combined model integrating breast and lung cancer detection.
